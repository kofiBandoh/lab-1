            <h2>Python</h2>
            <strong>Python</strong> was the first programming language that I was ever introduced to in Ashesi. And stayiing in Ashesi for two years I like to say that,
            I am an intermediate level when it comes to Python programming.<br> 
            For my first year project I built a programe which converts text into voice. This was with the aim of helping people who had a problem speaking up in public, 
            to do so throgh their laptop speakers. I have plans of making the programme better so it can be widely used by people.

            <h2>SQL</h2>
            <strong>SQL</strong> is a database management langauge. I have beginner's proficiency in my SQL. 
            The love for SQL, inspires me to futher my knowledge on the subject till I can be a professional at it.
