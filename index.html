        <p>
            Kofi Boampong Benefo-Bandoh is my name. I am a student at Ashesi University , majoring in Computer Science. 
            I am a proud member of the graduating class of 2022.
             Movies have always appealed to me and as such I spend quite an amount of time gathering movies to watch and also just to "collect" them. I one day hope to have a very large collection of movies which could end up being the largest in the world. 
        </p>

            I come from a town in the Ashanti Region of Ghana known as Asante Bekwai. I hope to visit one day.
