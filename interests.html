    <p>
        At Ashesi I am a member of the photography and film club.
        I also enagage in the Buddy-Up programme, in which freshman folk are helped by continuing students, to adjust to the new environment at Ashesi.
        I usually love to spend the little free time I have with a special person in my life. 
        Aside that I love to spend time watching movies, hope to build a movie collection of my own.
